                    <p>This interactive DEMO is structured as a series of scrollable slides, blending traditional
                        narrative with immersive media. A draggable <strong>info-panel</strong> overlays each slide,
                        providing context while allowing viewers to reveal layered visual content beneath. Navigation is
                        built into the panel via <strong>Next/Prev buttons</strong>.</p>

                    <h1>Born-Digital Genesis – From Concept to Code</h1>
                    Exploring the transformation of Vermeer’s The Milkmaid into a born-digital sculpture, this project
                    bridges classical art with contemporary digital expression. The pitcher, drawn from a quiet
                    historical scene, becomes the centre of a multimodal exploration of memory, form, and digital
                    presence. Inspired by Vermeer’s stillness, Milkmaid’s pitcher reimagines the familiar vessel as a
                    symbolic and sculptural digital object. Its journey begins in code, where layers of association and
                    reinterpretation unfold in an interactive, performative space.

                    <h1>The Dystopia of Imitation – Failure as Form</h1>
                    Through 3D scanning and digital sculpting, the project embraces the imperfect. Real-world objects
                    are scanned and transformed, often deformed in unexpected ways. These glitches are not
                    corrected—they are celebrated as creative material. In Milkmaid’s pitcher, failure becomes a method.
                    It subverts traditional expectations of representation, offering a new kind of abstraction. The
                    digital artefact mutates, melts, and slips away from mimesis, creating room for affect, concept, and
                    poetic dislocation.

                    <h1>The Virtual Gallery – A Multimodal Performance</h1>
                    The sculpture is not displayed—it is performed. Within a custom-built 3D gallery, the pitcher
                    rotates, responds, and reflects. The gallery itself draws from Vermeer’s interiors, blending
                    historic ambience with digital fluidity. Viewers navigate through space, encountering the work as
                    part of a layered, immersive experience. The digital exhibition challenges the notion of a fixed
                    object, instead offering interaction, play, and transformation. Art becomes an ongoing
                    event—accessible, decentralised, and participatory.

                    <h1>Reframing the Milkmaid – Augmented Reality as Remediation</h1>
                    By extending the sculpture into physical space through AR, Milkmaid’s pitcher bridges digital
                    creation and embodied experience. The object can be rotated, scaled, and viewed in real-time
                    settings, dissolving the boundary between virtual and real. In this remediated form, Vermeer’s
                    pitcher leaves the canvas and enters the present moment. The work invites the viewer not just to
                    see, but to engage—to become part of a distributed, democratic encounter with art that is no longer
                    locked inside a frame.<br />

                    <h1>The "Milkmaid's Pitcher" animated sculpture</h1>
                    In the background, you can see the original WebGL/WebXR application. On mobile devices, it allows
                    seamless switching between a 3D environment and Augmented Reality (AR).
                    The object on screen is a rotating digital sculpture — Milkmaid’s Pitcher — dynamically divided by
                    another invisible, rotating 3D form representing a splash of milk. This intersection creates a dual
                    experience: part of the sculpture remains in the 3D space, while the other emerges through AR.
                    Originally, the app could access the visitor's geo-location and capture snapshots of the sculptural
                    state in real time. Each result — a unique Boolean blend of two forms — was structured with metadata
                    for minting 205 NFTs, each representing a distinct sculptural moment.
                    The current version of the app (now with limited functionality due to NFT.storage deprecation) can
                    still be explored on android mobile devices by clicking

                    <h1>NFT Integration – Establishing Digital Provenance, Ownership and Aura</h1>
                    Tokenised as an NFT, the digital sculpture gains a new kind of presence: verified, traceable, and
                    uniquely owned. The metadata embedded in the NFT contains creation history, edits, and curatorial
                    context. This not only ensures provenance but redefines what it means for art to have value in
                    digital space. The aura of the artwork is no longer tied to location but to the transparency and
                    permanence of its blockchain identity. Ownership becomes decentralised, and the artwork,
                    immortalised in code, lives on as both object and data.

                    This web-based viewer presents a collection of 205 NFTs, each minted from a unique digital sculpture
                    derived from Milkmaid’s Pitcher. Every entry includes structured metadata, along with IPFS-hosted
                    assets: a preview image and a fully interactive 3D model.
                    Visitors can explore the entire collection, examine each NFT’s data structure, and engage with the
                    artworks through intuitive WebGL-based manipulation—zoom, pan, and rotate in real-time.
                    Designed to bridge visual art, metadata, and decentralized storage, the viewer offers an immersive
                    look into a generative, blockchain-based sculptural archive.
